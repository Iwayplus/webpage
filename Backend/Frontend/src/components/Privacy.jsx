      <p style={{ lineHeight: '1.6' }}>
When You use the App, We collect and store Your personal information which is provided by You from time to time. Our primary goal in doing so is to provide you a safe, efficient, smooth and customized experience. This allows Us to provide services and features that most likely meet Your needs, and to customize the App to make Your experience safer and easier. More importantly, while doing so We may collect personal information from You that We consider necessary for achieving this purpose.
</p>

      <p style={{ lineHeight: '1.6' }}>In general, You can browse the App without telling Us who You are or revealing any personal information about Yourself. Once You give Us Your personal information, You are not anonymous to us. Where possible, We indicate which fields are required and which fields are optional. You always have the option to not provide information by choosing not to use a particular service or feature on the App. We may automatically track certain information about You based upon Your behaviour on Our App. We use this information to do internal research on Our users' demographics, interests, and behaviour to better understand, protect and serve Our users.
